The Fibonacci sequence adds the two numbers previous to itself beginning at 0. This program allows the user to choose a position in the sequence and the program will tell the user what number is in that given position.

Here is the equation, the beginning of the Fibonacci sequence and an example of what a given position would return:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...;
F(0)=0; F(1)=1; F(2)=1;
